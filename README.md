Hello, my name is Odhiambo Brian Otieno.
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science from Chuka University, where I graduated with Second Class Honors (Upper Division).
During my studies and field attachment at the Ministry of Public Service and Special Programs at the Tharaka Nithi Huduma Centre, I gained extensive experience in database management,
system security, networking, and troubleshooting. 
I am passionate about leveraging my technical skills in project management, system diagnostics, and digital car mechanics. 
I am a team player who is resilient, hardworking, and eager to learn. 
I am enthusiastic about contributing to a dynamic organization where I can apply my knowledge, grow professionally, and help achieve organizational goals. 
My interests include programming, problem-solving, innovation, and community development, and I am always keen to acquire new knowledge across various professions.
